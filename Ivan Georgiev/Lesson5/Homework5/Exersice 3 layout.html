      <p>Then you know what happened to him? You know what happened, March 15th 1973? Yes Marty, I know. (Doc’s Garage) (It’s a mess. Doc opens a book. ‘Hill Valley Telegraph Archives March 1st - April 30th 1973’. On the page he turns to is a headline – “Local Author Shot Dead.” We stay focused on the paper as Doc speaks.) (v.o) I went to the public library to try and make sense out of all the madness. The place was boarded up, shut down, so I broke in and borrowed some newspapers.(Biff is now right next to Lorraine.) Alright, Biff. You win. I'll stay. (Lorraine goes down the stairs. Biff turns to Marty.) As for you, I’ll be back up here in an hour, so you'd better not be! (Biff leaves, slamming the doors as he goes. 3-D, Match and Skinhead follow him.)</p>
