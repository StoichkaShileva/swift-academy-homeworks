        <p>You're the doc, Doc. Alright then. Let's get the Delorean and get ourselves back to the future! (casually) Oh Doc, I tore a hole in the gas tank. We'll have to patch it up and get gas. (Freezes in place) You mean we're out of gas? (still casual) Yeah, no big deal, we got Mr. Fusion, right?(The camera pulls out to reveal 2015 Biff behind a tree. He watches as 1955 Biff opens the car door and gets in.) No, you just got to have the right touch. Nobody can start this car but me. The bill comes to $302 and 57 cents... 300 bucks? (He gets out of the car.) 300 bucks for a couple of dents? No, hey, that's bullshit Terry. No Biff, it was horseshit, the whole car was filled with it.(Strickland’s Office) (The sign says "S S Strickland, Discipline." Marty pears in and sees Strickland pouring himself a drink He puts the almanac on his desk. Marty quietly opens the door and creeps inside, unheard. The door slowly closes. Marty gets to the desk. He moves a little American flag on the desk out of the way and leans forward to grab the almanac. However the door closes and Strickland gets up. He goes to the door, wondering what happened, then opens and closes it again before sitting down. As he walks past his desk, we see Marty underneath it. Strickland hears something outside and moves his chair to the window to take a closer look. Marty tries to grab the almanac, but just as he does Strickland moves back again, hurting Marty's hand. Strickland finishes his drink, as Marty has his hat in his mouth to stop himself from making a noise and giving himself away. Strickland leans forward and Marty "rescues" his hand. Strickland gets up and takes the almanac. He leaves and throws the almanac in the bin. Once he's sure Strickland has gone, Marty gets it out of the bin.) Yes! (He flicks through, but it's not the almanac! It's Biff's girl magazine, with naked women in it, called Ooh La La. It seems Biff was hiding the magazine inside the almanac cover.) No! Ooh La La? (pause) Ooh La La? Ooh La La? (He gets out the walkie-talkie.) Doc, Doc! (Marty is standing by the window, and we can see Doc's Packard from Part 1 outside. Outside, George walks up to Lorraine's car. Marty does not see or hear him.) Hey you, get your damn hands off her! (realizes who's in there) Oh!</p>
