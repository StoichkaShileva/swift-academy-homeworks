                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I am 32 years old and I am keen on any type of coding. This came from my job as sharepoint designer and administrator where I had to develop, design and customize various apps and tools created on a sharepoint platform. Even though I have been using some software which helped me in designing cool stuff, at some point I realised that I will need to learn programming if I want to develop further. This is how I came to register for the Front-End development course and so far I have been enjoying it very much. I just wish I had more time to practice as there is so much to learn. On a personal note I have a 2 year-old toddler who is taking almost all my spare time and energy so doing my homework and learning new coding tricks is like a little rest for me ! this is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longerthis is just some more text to make my paragraph longerthis is just some more text to make my paragraph longerthis is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longerthis is just some more text to make my paragraph longerthis is just some more text to make my paragraph longerthis is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longerthis is just some more text to make my paragraph longer</p>

                <p>I have graduated the English High School in Bourgas in 2004 and then went for my bachelor in Arabic philology. Meanwhile I started working for a big IT company as a Business analyst developing various tools to improve the internal processes for our team. At some point I realised that this is what I want to do and even though I have my degree in Arabic philology, I do not intend to use it in my job, ever. I have been working in the IT world for about 8-9 years ( who counts :) ) moving in different teams and fulfilling various roles such as data analyst, business analyst, team leader, information manager, etc. This has resulted in getting to know the standard IT processes, as well as the IT business overall and being able to find ways of imrpoving the day-to-day work of IT engineers, optimizing business processes and helping teams to save time and effort by creating simple internal sharepoint-based solutions for them.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longerthis is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.this is just some more text to make my paragraph longer.</p>

                <p> Unfortunately I cannot share an example of my projects as they are all part of the HP internal network, but y biggest accomplishment created on a sharepoint platform was a tool called Deal Delivery tracker. This is something that I created from a scratch using a few sharepoint lists tied together with multiple sharepoint designer workflows, infopath forms and so on. The whole project toook me about 6 months until I started the pilot of the tool and for me it was a great experience as I played the role of a Project manager, sharepoint designer/ developer, business analyst and so on. After a few waves of changes, the tool was successful, started being used by a few delivery departments ( more than 1000 users filling in and using data ) and after a couple of months, this tool became gloabl which means that it started being used from all regions of the company. Naturally, it was handed over to a team of professional developer but the satisfaction for me is that I designed it, I tested it and I put it to live and it worked !

                <p> Travel request portal. This is a system used to request and approve travels for IT engineers. It also worked out well and save time for the team.
